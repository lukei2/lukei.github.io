    <h1>Oreo Extended</h1>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>Oreo is my first solo combat robot. I decided to build a translational drift robot mostly because I though it would be fun and challenging.
        Translational drift or "melty-brain" robots are very uncommon in combat robotics because they are difficult to drive and design.
        I wanted to use this opportunity to do something unique and hopefully build a succesful bot.

    <h3>What is a melty-brain?</h3>
    <p>Mellty brain robots spin up their whole body and pulse motors in order to translate while rotating.
        One can imagine the superposition of a bunch of force vectors on one side of a circle (pictured below).
        If you add them all up, you will end up with a vector pointing straight in one direction, the direction of translation.

        <br>
        There are a couple benefits to this strategy. One is that you can use the entire robot's mass as the weapon.
        Since the robot is wider than a normal spinning weapon, this also leads to a higher moment of inertia.
        This also significantly increases tip speed for a given RPM, which can be helpful for taking the advcanatage in weapon to weapon hits.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main disadvantage of a melty brain is that it is helpless when not spinning.
        It has weak maneuverability, and is easily pinned and tossed around.

    <h3>Design and Limitations</h3>
    <p>I threw together a CAD model as a preliminary idea when I first decided to build a melty (shown below).
        After reviewing current succesful bots, I realized that this design was way too complex.
        There were more parts than necessary which increased failure modes and took away from the weight I could use for more useful things.

        After analyzing other current melty-brain designs, I found some improvements I could make for V2. First of all,
        I decided to make the frame of the robot rest join with the weapon itself. The main structure would be a hardened steel ring
        which doubles as the weapon. This would protect the internals of the robot with an inch of steel as opposed to quarter inch TPU.
        For the weapon, I decided to switch from two teeth to one. This increases the "bite" of the weapon
        while also making the bot easier to balance (the weight of the battery offsets the weight of the weapon).
        I also simplified the suspension system. Instead of belts and bulky wheels, I decided to mount some laser cut spring steel wheels
        directly to the motors. I attached the motors to the frame via TPU mounts, which allows for more flex to absorb force for the motors.
        I also did some hand calcs to choose an outer diameter where the robot could spin up to 100 RPM in three seconds.
        <br>
        These considerations led me to the design shown below.

    <h3>Electronics</h3>
    <p>The general idea to Oreo's circuitry is that a 22V LiPo powers and Arduino Nano which recieves signal from an RC
        transmitter and an accelerometer. The reciever tells the Arduino the users intended movement, and the accelerometer
        tells the arduino how fast were spinning using a radial acceleration -> rotational frequency calculation.
        The arduino sends PWM signals to the ESCs depending on the input signal.
        An LED is also illuminated once per rotation to mark the heading direction.

        Here is the electrical diagram for me robot, sourced from an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/nothinglabs/openmelt2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenmeltV2</a>.

    <h3>Analysis & Improvement</h3>
    <p>KRATOS has had a number of hardware challenges in its first year of life. The primary challenge we face is that
        the weapon simply produces too much torque upon impact. In our first battle, we found that our weapon had deformed from too much torque.
        To remedy this we switched from a three pronged weapon to a one pronged weapon which offered more reinforcement.
        <br>
        <br>
        alongside the weapon challenges, the chain would break on the first hit of most matches.
        This was originally caused by flexion in the weapon towards the body of the robot. We solved thhis problem by adding a weapon guard around the chain
        (made from UHMW), but found that the chain was still breaking due to the force of the impact. In order to fix this problem, we plan to replace the chain
        system with a gear system.
        <br>
        <br>
        We also found that KRATOS kept burning out its ESC.
        Apart from the ESC not being able to supply enough current for spin up, the motor would produce strong back EMF when the blade made contact
        with another robot. Both of these issues ended up frying the ESC. In order to solve this, one of my teammates built his own custon high power ESC
        which we will be using in February. In the meantime, we turned down the max speed of the motor.
