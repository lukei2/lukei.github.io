    <h1>Oreo Extended</h1>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>Oreo is my first solo combat robot. I decided to build a translational drift robot mostly because I thought it would be fun and challenging.
        Translational drift or "melty-brain" robots are very uncommon in combat robotics because they are difficult to drive and design.
        I wanted to use this opportunity to do something unique and hopefully build a successful bot.

    <h3>What is a melty-brain?</h3>
    <p>Melty-brain robots spin their entire body and pulse their drive motors to generate translation while rotating.
        This motion can be understood as the superposition of force vectors applied on one side of a rotating circle
        (pictured below). When summed, these vectors produce a net force in a single direction, resulting in translation.

        <br>
        One major benefit of this strategy is that the entire mass of the robot acts as the weapon.
        Because the robot’s diameter is larger than that of a conventional spinning weapon,
        this results in a higher moment of inertia and increased tip speed at a given RPM,
        which can be advantageous in weapon-to-weapon impacts.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main disadvantage of a melty-brain is that it is helpless when not spinning.
        It has weak maneuverability, and is easily pinned and tossed around.

    <h3>Design and Limitations</h3>
    <p>I created an initial CAD model as a preliminary concept when I first decided to build a melty-brain robot (shown below).
        After reviewing current succesful bots, I realized that this design was too complex.
        There were more parts than necessary, which increased failure modes and consumed weight that could be better allocated elsewhere.

    </div>
    <p>After analyzing other current melty-brain designs, I found some improvements I could make for V2. First of all,
        I decided to make the frame of the robot one with the weapon itself. The main structure would be a hardened steel ring
        which doubles as the weapon. This would protect the internals of the robot with an inch of steel as opposed to quarter-inch TPU.
        For the weapon, I decided to switch from two teeth to one. This increases the "bite" of the weapon
        while also making the bot easier to balance (the weight of the battery offsets the weight of the weapon).
        I also simplified the suspension system. Instead of belts and bulky wheels, I decided to mount some laser cut spring steel wheels
        directly to the motors. I attached the motors to the frame via TPU mounts, which allows for more flex to absorb force for the motors.
        I also did some hand calcs to choose an outer diameter where the robot could spin up to 100 RPM in three seconds.
        <br>
        These considerations led me to the design shown below.

    <h3>Electronics</h3>
    <p>The general idea behind Oreo’s electronics is that a 22 V LiPo powers an Arduino Nano through a buck converter.
        The Arduino receives input from an RC transmitter and an accelerometer.
        The receiver provides the user’s intended movement, while the accelerometer measures radial acceleration,
        which is converted into rotational frequency to determine spin rate. Based on these inputs,
        the Arduino sends PWM signals to the ESCs. An LED is illuminated once per rotation to indicate the robot’s heading.

        The electrical schematic for the robot is shown below and is based on the open-source project. <a href="https://github.com/nothinglabs/openmelt2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenmeltV2</a>.

    <h3>Analysis & Improvement</h3>
    <p>KRATOS has had a number of hardware challenges in its first year of life. The primary challenge we face is that
        the weapon simply produces too much torque upon impact. In our first battle, we found that our weapon had deformed from too much torque.
        To remedy this we switched from a three pronged weapon to a one pronged weapon which offered more reinforcement.
        <br>
        <br>
        alongside the weapon challenges, the chain would break on the first hit of most matches.
        This was originally caused by flexion in the weapon towards the body of the robot. We solved thhis problem by adding a weapon guard around the chain
        (made from UHMW), but found that the chain was still breaking due to the force of the impact. In order to fix this problem, we plan to replace the chain
        system with a gear system.
        <br>
        <br>
        We also found that KRATOS kept burning out its ESC.
        Apart from the ESC not being able to supply enough current for spin up, the motor would produce strong back EMF when the blade made contact
        with another robot. Both of these issues ended up frying the ESC. In order to solve this, one of my teammates built his own custon high power ESC
        which we will be using in February. In the meantime, we turned down the max speed of the motor.
