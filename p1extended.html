    <h1>KRATOS Extended</h1>
    
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>In combat robotics, the best defense is a good offense. This idea is taken to heart with MIT CRC's newest 30 lb. robot KRATOS.
        KRATOS uses an overhead spinner encompassing the entire robot's footprint to deal serious damage to any robot which comes close.
        </p>

    <h3>Design and Limitations</h3>
    <p>The biggest drawback with an overhead spinner is slow spin up times. Because the moment of inertia is so large, most overheads defenseless.
        Our solution to this problem was to use a novel type of brushless motor called an axial-flux motor. These kinds of motors are very common in 
        electric vehicles. Unfortunately there are not sold or produced for our scale, so we had to build our own.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next limiting factor to consider is blade height. There are a couple factors that make this quantity important,
        but to summarize the important and less defended parts of a robot (wheels, motors, wedges, etc) are closer to the ground.
        If we want to deal serious damage, we will have to keep our robot as flat as possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        As for materials, we decided to use UHMW for our main chassis and side guards. UHMW is able to take a large amount of force and break in a controlled way
        way without transferring too much force to the robot itself. It is also cheap and easy to replace, 
        so when it breaks we are able to quickly and affordably replace it. For our weapon, we decided to go with hardened steel.
        Hardened steel is rigid enough to deliver high forces to opponent robots, yet compliant enough to deform slightly without breaking.
        <br>
        <br>
        These considerations helped lead us to our preliminary design shown below.

    <h3>Building</h3>
    <p>Constructing KRATOS consisted of lots of machining. Apart from the UHMW chassis which we ordered pre CNCed, we manufactured the rest of the parts
        which were not able to buy off the shelf. We also assembled our axial-flux motor from scratch (apart from ordering the necessary PCBs). 
        My main role in the construction of this robot was creating the CAM files in Fusion360, machining them on the CNC mill, and soldering/electrical wiring.
        I have also worked on the pit/repair team for KRATOS during competitions.

    <h3>Analysis & Improvement</h3>
    <p>KRATOS has had a number of hardware challenges in its first year of life. The primary challenge we face is that
        the weapon simply produces too much torque upon impact. In our first battle, we found that our weapon had deformed from too much torque.
        To remedy this we switched from a three pronged weapon to a one pronged weapon which offered more reinforcement. 
        
        alongside the weapon challenges, the chain would break on the first hit of most matches.
        This was originally caused by flexion in the weapon towards the body of the robot. We solved thhis problem by adding a weapon guard around the chain
        (made from UHMW), but found that the chain was still breaking due to the force of the impact. In order to fix this problem, we plan to replace the chain
        system with a gear system.
        
        We also found that KRATOS kept burning out its ESC. 
        Apart from the ESC not being able to supply enough current for spin up, the motor would produce strong back EMF when the blade made contact
        with another robot. Both of these issues ended up frying the ESC. In order to solve this, one of my teammates built his own custon high power ESC
        which we will be using in February. In the meantime, we turned down the max speed of the motor.
